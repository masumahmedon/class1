		<p>Hobby is the favorite work of a person that he likes to do in this leisure time. It is not one's occupation. It does not bring money. It gives one joy and removes monotonyof works. I am a student.  My favorite hobby is reading books. Whenever, I get time,I read the books of my choice. I like it because of some reasons. I know that books are the best friend. Reading books help me to gather much knowledge. It removes my monotony. It broadens my outlook. I read different kinds of books such as storybooks,novels,poems,essays,detective novels etc. I spend at least two hours a day for my hobby. It gives me much pleasure. Therefore, everybody should have a hobby that gives him pleasure and knowledge.</p>
